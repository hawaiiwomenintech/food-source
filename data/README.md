# Data

- For any data that you gather, please place it in our dedicated Google Drive folder for this project, as GitHub is not the best place to store binary or large amounts of data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rUeBD8HfumPopjepbMHq608V1koQrHWP?usp=sharing
- This folder is mainly for working with the data after you download it from Google Drive. But we should try not to commit anything to this folder, except perhaps for sample data files.
