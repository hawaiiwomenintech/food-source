# Outputs

- Any output files or saved models should belong here.
- However, we shouldn't commit our saved binary model files because GitHub doesn't handle binary or large files well.
- But we can save model results (such as metrics) here if the files aren't too large (in plain text, CSV, or JSON format).
- If you'd like to share your saved model or checkpoint, feel free to upload it here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rUeBD8HfumPopjepbMHq608V1koQrHWP?usp=sharing
