# Outputs

- We can save results (such as metrics) here if the files aren't too large (in plain text, CSV, or JSON format).
- But we shouldn't commit our saved binary model files here because GitHub doesn't handle binary or large files well; however, we can use this folder to save our model files locally (GitHub should ignore it due to our [.gitignore](https://github.com/hawaiiwomenintech/food-source/blob/master/.gitignore) settings).
- If you'd like to share your saved model or checkpoint, feel free to upload it here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rUeBD8HfumPopjepbMHq608V1koQrHWP?usp=sharing
